# Breast_Cancer-Classification

#### The goal of this project was to evaluate the performance of five supervised learning algorithms on the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The dataset contains information about various features of breast tumors, categorized as either benign or malignant. Our focus was on identifying the best-performing model based on accuracy.

### 1. Logistic Regression
How it Works: Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of a class (e.g., benign or malignant) using the sigmoid function to map linear outputs to probabilities between 0 and 1. The decision boundary is determined by a threshold (usually 0.5).
Why Suitable for This Dataset:
Works well for linearly separable data.
Provides interpretable results, especially for binary classification problems like this one.
